# awesomewm-gruvbox

A gruvbox'd setup with minimal tweaks of the powerarrow-dark theme in [awesome-copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats).

## Opt In Features

See available controls with `Super+s`. 
For some of these features, the following need to 
be available on `$PATH` (though not necessary for function):

`rofi` (macOS spotlight/context switcher)

`flameshot` (screenshots)

`pactl` (volume control via PulseAudio)

`playerctl` (media controls, Spotify compatible)

`slock` (simple X screenlocker)

`xss-lock` (Used to delegate XScreenlocker locking activity to `slock`)

`xrandr` (For interacting with X)

## Setup

Install in the following path:
```
$HOME/.config/awesome
```

## Acknowledgements

This setup is based entirely off of the config files from the user `cole-bishop`. The repository
can be found [here](https://github.com/cole-bishop/awesomewm-gruvbox) and serves as a fantastic
base for your own configurations.
