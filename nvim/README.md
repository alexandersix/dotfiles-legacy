# Nvim Configuration

My current Neovim configuration is a forked, VERY adjusted version of the [AstroVim](https://github.com/kabinspace/AstroVim) project. It will likely change into a more minimal, basic install over time, but I wanted to see how far someone could get by hacking an existing configuration. If nothing else, it was a great exercise in changing my configurations to be Lua-based instead of Vimscript-based.
