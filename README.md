## Description

These are my personal dotfiles that I use on all of my systems. As my needs
change, these dotfiles are also subject to change. Regardless, feel free to
use as much or as little of this repository as is helpful. With that said,
I _always_ encourage knowing exactly what each piece of configuration does
for each of your applications.
